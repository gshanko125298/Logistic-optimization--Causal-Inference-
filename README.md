# Logistic-optimization
A logistics optimization process will enable you to increase your supply chain efficiency. The aim of the project is to work on its dataset that  help it understand the primary causes of unfulfilled requests as well as come up with solutions that recommend and support to identify the reason that led to a high number of unfulfilled delivery requests. so, some of the non-technical  activity to achieve logistic optimization are the following: 

To efficiently manage your flows, establish relationships of trust between the actors of the Supply Chain, reduce the risks of malfunctioning by improving communication, reach or maintain an optimal quality level, make logistics processes more flexible, reduce your costs, increase your margins, reduce your delivery times and  increase customer satisfaction.

Causal inference refers to an intellectual discipline that considers the assumptions, study designs, and estimation strategies that allow researchers to draw causal conclusions based on data. As detailed below, the term ‘causal conclusion’ used here refers to a conclusion regarding the effect of a causal variable  on some outcome(s) of interest. The dominant perspective on causal inference in statistics has philosophical underpinnings that rely on consideration of counterfactual states
# Data and feature 
There are two datasets available for this project. The two types of data is the delivery data and order data provided to the project as sample dataset. 

# Technical Section 
Technical activity that will be done for logistic optimization are the following:
- Data Exploration
