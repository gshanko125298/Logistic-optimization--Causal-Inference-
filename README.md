# Logistic-optimization--Causal-Inference-
Objective of the project is to work on its data to help it understand the primary causes of unfulfilled requests as well as come up with solutions that recommend drivers locations that increase the fraction of complete orders.

A logistics optimization process will enable you to increase your supply chain efficiency. The aim of the project is to work on its dataset that help it understand the primary causes of unfulfilled requests as well as come up with solutions that recommend and support to identify the reason that led to a high number of unfulfilled delivery requests. so, some of the non-technical activity to achieve logistic optimization are the following: to efficiently manage your flows, establish relationships of trust between the actors of the Supply Chain, reduce the risks of malfunctioning by improving communication, reach or maintain an optimal quality level, make logistics processes more flexible, reduce your costs, increase your margins, reduce your delivery times and increase customer satisfaction.
# Data and feature

There are two datasets available for this project. The two types of data is the delivery data and order data provided to the project as sample dataset.
Technical Section

# Technical activity that will be done for logistic optimization are the following:

- Data Exploration
- Causal learning
- Logistic optimization .
