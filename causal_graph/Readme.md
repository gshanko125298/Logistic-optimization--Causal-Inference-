# CausalGraphicalModels
Causal inference is a technique by which we determine if the causal explanation is accurate; in scenarios like those outlined above. 
It works by controlling confounding factors. It gives us a better understanding of the causes and impacts so that we can make better decisions.

causalgraphicalmodels is a python module for describing and manipulating Causal Graphical Models and Structural Causal Models. 
Behind the scenes it is a light wrapper around the python graph library networkx, together with some CGM specific tools.
It is currently in a very early stage of development. All feedback is welcome.
